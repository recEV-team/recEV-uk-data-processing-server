        longDescription: 'We are a registered charitable organization providing employment services for people with disabilities, otherwise known as an Australian Disability Enterprise (ADE). The organization was originally set up by a group of people with physical disabilities back in 1949 as a self-help group for people within the community whose disabilities were not due to war service. As such, it is one of the oldest organizations of its type now operating in Australia. Today, Access Industries provides supported employment opportunities for close to 250 people with disabilities in ADE\u2019s located at Seven Hills, Erskine Park and Horsley Park in the Sydney Metropolitan Area, Hamilton (Newcastle), and Lithgow. The total number of employees is circa 500. Access Industries provides a supportive and professional workplace that creates opportunities for people with disabilities achieve economic and community participation through meaningful employment. All employees of Access Industries receive training and support to deliver quality products for our customers. As part of its commitment to providing quality services, Access Industries employs skilled Training Officers and Welfare Officers to provide or organise additional training and support for its supported employees (i.e. employees who have a disability). This enables supported employees to optimise their work potential and personal skills, and for those wishing to do so, helps to prepare them to move on into open employment.',
